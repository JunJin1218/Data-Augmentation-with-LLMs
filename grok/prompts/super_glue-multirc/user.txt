You are given several examples of labeled MultiRC instances.

Each instance follows this schema:
{
  "Passage": "<short coherent paragraph>",
  "Question": "<specific question answerable from the passage>",
  "Answers": [
    {"Text": "<candidate answer>", "Label": 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect},
    {"Text": "<candidate answer>", "Label": 1/0},
    ...
  ]
}
