You are given several examples of labeled WiC (Word-in-Context) instances.

Each instance follows this schema:
{
  "Word": "<target word>",
  "Sentence1": "<sentence containing the word>",
  "Sentence2": "<another sentence containing the same word>",
  "Label": 1 if the word has the SAME meaning in both sentences, 0 if DIFFERENT
}
